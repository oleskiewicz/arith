# arith
Containers with arithmetic operations support.

## Usage

	arithmap!{"a" => 1, "b" => 2} + 1 == arithmap!{"a" => 2, "b" => 3};
	arithmap!{"a" => 1, "b" => 2} + arithmap!{"b" => 2, "c" => 3} == arithmap!{"a" => 1, "b" => 4, "c" => 3};
	(arithmap!{"a" => 0, "b" => 1}.prune()) == arithmap!{"b" => 1};

You can access underlying values with `.hashmap` field.  For now only `&'a str` keys are
supported, until I convince the borrow checker to let me use a generic key type.
